Network Scanning is the task of finding running services and hosts on a network.
In casual parlance, "what computers are connected to this router and what do they
seem to do?"

Attackers commonly perform it to understand private networks they have intruded onto.
Network Engineers also use it, to understand their own networks and fix problems before
Attackers can use them.

This practical teaches how to perform network scanning with commonly-used tools, how
to abuse services to act as private network scanners, and the mindsets to build
defendable services and networks.

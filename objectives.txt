Each network service is an opportunity for discovery, enumeration, denial of service and exploitation.
* Discovery: find servers on the network.
* Enumeration: list running services.
* Denial of service: abuse services to saturate the network.
* Exploitation: hack into services or phish users.

Firewalls can be used for perimeter defence, but there are many different ways to punch through them.
* Protocol bugs e.g. FTP Bounce.
* DNS Rebinding.
* Stealing a device connected to your VPN.
* A malicious employee.
* â€¦

In practice can limit some of these risks, but not all. Need defence in depth.
* Every running service should be necessary, not have any known vulnerabilities, and be carefully configured.
* Assume attackers will get on your internal network and plan for that.
* Building your own network services is something to do very carefully.
